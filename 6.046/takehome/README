Your answers to the takehome must be submitted as a PDF, and we urge all
students to use LaTeX to typeset their solutions. For your convenience we have
prepared a couple LaTeX packages and a simple class file:

clrscode4e.sty
    a slight modification of Thomas H. Cormen's clrscode3e.sty
    for typesetting pseudo-code. For detailed documentation see:
    http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrscode/
	[this has not been changed from the version included with the
	homework template]
6046.sty
    a package with useful macros for typesetting math and proofs
	[this has not been changed from the version included with the
	homework template]
6046.cls
    a simple document class that imports the recommended packages
	[this has not been changed from the version included with the
	homework template]
takehome.sty
    a package that overrides the 6046.sty formatting to create a
	coverpage for your solutions 
takehome.tex
    a template containing the text of the problems
Makefile
    a GNU make file to simplify creating PDFs from LaTeX source
	[this has not been changed from the version included with the
	homework template]

=== Usage ===

Unpack all contents of the package to one folder, then edit the file
takehome.tex.  Remember to update your name, and uncomment the line 
containing your recitation!

If you have already downloaded the templates for the homework and
just want to add the template for the takehome, copy takehome.sty and
takehome.tex to the directory containing your homework. 

=== Makefile ===

We included a Makefile to make building PDF files less of a hassle.
Assuming your document is contained completely in one file called
takehome.tex, you can create takehome.pdf by executing:

  make takehome.pdf
