  General Questions:
    2. Using Data Wrangler was a pretty terrible experience. The javascript
version crashed very frequently when I attempted to do certain commands. The
other thing about Data Wrangler is that it had no documentation, making it
difficult to learn how to do anything that wasn't automatically suggested for
you. The very specific syntax needed for some commands did not help, for
instance like 'index in (1)'. The command line tools were in general much more
reliable than Data Wrangler and provided a much neater interface. There were
things that Data Wrangler just couldn't do (like edit or manipulate data).
This was incredibly frustrating because that is one of the easiest parts of
data processing.
    3. It would be very useful if you could edit data in Data Wrangler. Right
now, the edit tab does not work (or is unresponsive). It would also make sense
to be able to create a column of data with numbers.
